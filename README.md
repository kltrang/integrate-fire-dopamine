Integrate-and-Fire Model of Dopamine to inform Drug Addiction

This code is based on the paper: "A mathematical model of reward-mediated learning in drug adduction" (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0082997)
The model was adapted for a final project in BME 4409 Quantitative Physiology
This program contains functions for plotting a graph similar to that found in Fig 2 of the paper and a pair of w(t|theta) and RPE plots over time.
